# Ntds Project 2019

## need a Titile for the project - Team 22

### Pre-requisites
To run the project, you will need python3 along with *ntds_2019* environment. The codes are tested on *Python 3.7.3*.
Dataset can be found at .... link please. * to do *

### Datasets
*to do*: please copy description of dataset here


### Structure of the codes
This repo contains several files for the entire project. 

- Project.ipynb
This is the main file of the project. It is constructed by three following sections:
 - I. Load, clean, study and prepare the data for graph creation
Dataset is loaded and cleaned in the subsection *I.1*. Then a deep study of dataset can be found at the subsection *I.2*.

 - II. Creation of simple graph following structure of migration & first attempt to predict county type
Divers graphs are created and studied from the dataset to understand the structure of a migration. Graphs are studied through observations using Gephi, degree of county (i.e node of the graph), degree neighboring nodes of county and  ----- Graph observation(Part of anshul?)----
 
 - III. Study of a similarity graph for prediction
In this section, we tried to do more sophisticated methods such as GCN and Fourier with Laplacian analyse on different graphs.

- utils.py
This file contains helper functions for graph analyses, including GFT and GCN. Please refer to function doc for further information.
